# ANLP-project
by Galina Ryazanskaya, 811155

This is the final project ANLP. All the code for the project is included in the Jupiter Notebook. 
The initial plan for the project included using [deepPavlovEval](https://github.com/deepmipt/deepPavlovEval#datasets-and-tasks), but it turned out to be out of maintenence. Additionally, I intended to do this project with a partner, who dropped out, and I fell severely ill. Thus, I decided to only implement the Semantic textual similarity task as the evaluation mode.
